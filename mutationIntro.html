        <p>Mutation is defined as an <em>error</em> in DNA copying. Somatic mutations influence somatic cellsâ€”i.e., all cells of the body other than those that
            directly produce the gametes. Germinal mutations affect the cells that directly turn into the gametes.

            <em>Germinal mutations are the live force behind evolution.</em>

            In the next step, we'll first randomly generate a sequence of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases (cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A] or thymine [T]).
            Then we'll bring mutation into the picture and observe how after a certain number of generations, the initial sequence changes in different ways.
