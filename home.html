            There are four major driving forces behind evolution.
            <ul>
                <li>Genetic drift</li>
                <li>Mutation</li>
                <li>Natural selection</li>
                <li>Migration</li>
            </ul>
            Two more forces, namely <em>culture</em> and <em>population mating structure</em>,
            are new in the sense that they are not explicated in traditional texts.
            For more details on the four forces, check <a href = "http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/hgss/hgsschapters/hgss_chapter13.pdf" target="_blank">this</a> out.

            In the following pages, we shall explore the effects of genetic drift and mutation. In nature, all these forces donot operate in individual vacuums.
            Instead, they have dynamic interactions.
